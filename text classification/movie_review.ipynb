      "rejecting her natural abilities , she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type . \r\n",
      "gloria is her latest disaster . \r\n",

      "janeane garofalo , for example , is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone's part in basic instinct ; neither is stone any less talented because she couldn't do garofalo's comedic roles . \r\n",
      "gloria , directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes , was not screened in advance for critics , almost always a sign that the studio isn't behind the picture . \r\n",
      "after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened , it is clear why they held it from the press . \r\n",
      "it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed . \r\n",

      "she's got a bad attitude and a big mouth . \r\n",
      "she also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents , a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast . \r\n",

      "just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria's ex-boyfriend kevin ( jeremy northam ) , nicky's dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin's operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice . \r\n",
